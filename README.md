HibernateTest
=============

Hibernate Application , Connection test with Mysql


In this i used Mysql database software. here we need mysql connect/j driver.
you can download it from Mysql Corparaion.

In this my logical database name is 'rao', it is also called catalog

In hibenate.cfg.xml , we can find database name with rao, 
username is root, there is no password that's
why i didn't specify that property.

And we need mysql Dialect, propery name 'show_sql' =true for observing queries generated by hibernate.
